lists can be added to easily manage multiple mobile phones at once.
They can reference the mobile phone of users as well as contain
explicit (external) phones. These lists can then be used a recipients
for messages sent by SMS event handlers.</p>

<p>Use the <img alt="" src="images/book_add_green.png"> icon to create a new phones list, or edit an existing list by clicking it's name in the list.</p>

<p>When editing a list, use the <img src="images/add.png"> icon to
append the user's or explicit phone to the list. (Note that changes to
the user's mobile phone when editing a user will also update the phones
list.) A user entry in the list is designated with a user icon
(depending on the user's type); an explicit phone is listed with a <img alt="" src="images/phone.png">. To remove an entry in the list, click the <img src="images/bullet_delete.png"> icon associated with the entry.</p>

<p>To save your changes to a list, click the <img src="images/save.png"> icon. To delete an entire list, click the <img src="images/delete.png"> icon. To send a test SMS to all of the current entries in the list, click the <img alt="" src="images/sms_go.png"> icon.</p></body></html>
